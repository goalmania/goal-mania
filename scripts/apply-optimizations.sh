echo "📖 Next steps:"
echo "  1. Start your development server: pnpm dev"
echo "  2. Test the API endpoints to see performance improvements"
echo "  3. Monitor performance using the built-in monitoring tools"
echo "  4. Review docs/API_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md for detailed usage"

echo "🔍 Performance monitoring:"
echo "  • Check X-Cache headers in API responses (HIT/MISS)"
echo "  • Monitor console for slow operation warnings (>1s)"
echo "  • Use the performance monitoring utilities in your code"
